# Google-STOCK-price_RNN-LSTM
GOOGLE stock price prediction using Recurrent Neural Network with LSTM model.
The art of forecasting stock prices has been a difficult task for many of the researchers and analysts. In fact, investors are highly interested in the research area of stock price prediction. For a good and successful investment, many investors are keen on knowing the future situation of the stock market. Good and effective prediction systems for the stock market help traders, investors, and analyst by providing supportive information like the future direction of the stock market. In this work, we present a recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) approach to predict stock market indices

**Action:** 60 time stamps is taken to predict the stock price for next one month
